# Monk Vim

These are my vim files... yes, I am joining the ranks of people who use modal editors. "But you have a Sublime config repo..."
Vintage mode is nice but sometimes you just need the real thing. I still use Sublime, just a bit less frequently...

## Installation

`git clone git://github.com/MichaelMartinez/monk_vim.git ~/.vim && ~/.vim/setup.sh`

You can also install `fonts/Inconsolata-g-Powerline.ttf` if you want fancy powerline symbols. If not you may want to disable fancy in your `.vimrc.local`.
